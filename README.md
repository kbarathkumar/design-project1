## Project Overview

### 1. **Simple Self-Driving Car Simulation**
This Python project simulates a basic self-driving car using object-oriented programming. The car moves in a grid-like environment, allowing actions like moving forward, turning left, and turning right. The car tracks its position and facing direction in real-time.

### 2. **Hand Gesture Control for Mouse Interaction**
This project implements a hand gesture recognition system using **OpenCV** and **MediaPipe** to enable mouse actions like clicks, double clicks, and screenshots based on specific hand gestures.

---

## Features

### Simple Self-Driving Car Simulation
- Navigate a car within a simulated grid.
- Commands include:
  - **Move forward**.
  - **Turn left** (changes direction counterclockwise).
  - **Turn right** (changes direction clockwise).
- Real-time position and direction updates printed to the console.

### Hand Gesture Control for Mouse Interaction
- **Mouse movement** based on the index finger tip's position.
- Gesture-based actions:
  - **Left click**.
  - **Right click**.
  - **Double click**.
  - **Screenshot** (saved with a random label).
- Visual feedback on detected gestures using OpenCV.

## Requirements

### Dependencies
- **Python 3.7+**
- Libraries:
  - [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) (`cv2`)
  - [MediaPipe](https://mediapipe.dev/)
  - [PyAutoGUI](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/)
  - [Pynput](https://pynput.readthedocs.io/)

### Installation
1. Install Python packages:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python mediapipe pyautogui pynput numpy
   ```

---

## How to Run

### Simple Self-Driving Car Simulation
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Sorce_Code-1.py
   ```
2. Observe the car's movements in the console.

### Hand Gesture Control for Mouse Interaction
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python Source_Code-2.py
   ```
2. Ensure your webcam is functional.
3. Use hand gestures in front of the camera for:
   - Mouse movement.
   - Click actions.
   - Taking screenshots.

---

## Troubleshooting
- **Script not running**: Check that all dependencies are installed correctly.
- **Webcam not working**: Ensure your camera is connected and accessible by OpenCV.
- **Gesture not detected**: Adjust lighting and background for better recognition.

---

## Future Enhancements
1. **Self-Driving Car**:
   - Add real-world navigation simulation using sensors or map inputs.
2. **Gesture Control**:
   - Support multi-hand gestures.
   - Enhance gesture recognition using machine learning.
